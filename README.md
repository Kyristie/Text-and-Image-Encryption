Message to Image Encryption is a form of steganography which involves embedding a secret message (such as text) inside an image file in a way that the image remains visually unchanged to the human eye but contains hidden data. 
	The message is hidden in the image by manipulating the pixel values or certain attributes of the image in a way that it is not noticeable when the image is viewed normally.


 Image-to-image encryption is a methods that hide or encode image in another image to produce a new transformed image.  
		By transforming an image into another (scrambled or altered) image, encryption protects visual data while still allowing it to be recovered or verified.
		Image-to-Image Encryption is an important technique used in fields like digital security, privacy and authentication.
